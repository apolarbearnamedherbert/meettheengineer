		<!-- This section is going to include THE quote from "Meet the Engineer" in a blockquote and a paragraph element describing him. The blockquote text is centered and broken into separate lines to make reading the quote more natural. I'd like to have some sort of color around this box distinguishing it from the elements around it. -->
		<h2>About</h2>
		<blockquote>
				<i>"Hey look, buddy. I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems.
			<br>Not problems like "What is beauty?" 'cause that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
			<br>I solve practical problems."</i>
			<br>- The Engineer, on the nature of engineering
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Engineer is a fine Southern gentleman from Texas who is as dangerous as he is amiable. Don't be fooled by his friendly smile or his soothing guitar: the man is a stone-cold killer. His area of expertise is building machines that support his teammates. The result? Complete area denial.</p>

		<!-- This section lists out all of Engineer's capabilities in an unordered list. I had to remember that you declare the unordered list and then individually code in each list item.

		My intention is to include some h3 elements, images, and a brief paragraph element description for each. Hopefully this goes as I imagine it in my head. -->
		<h2>Abilities</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Gun</h3></li>
				<img src="img/shotgun.jpg" height="50" width="50" title="How about some frontier justice?">
				<p>The Engineer ain't one to showboat, but if he needs to defend himself, he most definitely can.</p>
			<li><h3>More Gun</h3></li>
				<img src="img/sentry.jpg" height="50" width="50" title="If that don't work, use more gun.">
				<p>The Engineer builds a sentry gun to defend an area. This gun automatically detects and shoots at targets and can be leveled up for more firepower.</p>
			<li><h3>Drugstore Cowboy</h3></li>
				<img src="img/dispenser.jpg" height="50" width="50" title="No one knows how it works, but there are some needles on a shelf.">
				<p>The Engineer builds a dispenser to support teammates. The dispenser gives health and ammo to any teammate who stands within its radius. It can be upgraded to offer supplies much more quickly.</p>
			<li><h3>Battle Rustler</h3></li>
				<img src="img/teleporter.jpg" height="50" width="50" title="Also a good source of whole grains.">
				<p>The Engineer builds a set of teleporters to get teammates to the front line much more quickly. Players can enter the teleporter entrance and immediately be taken to the location of the teleporter exit. This building can be upgraded to send players to the front lines more quickly.</p>

		<!-- This section will include an image of Engi from the comics, a caption, and then a description of his plotline. I want the image and caption centered and the last description aligning on the left.

			In order to center the image, I had to create a class called "center" and then follow up in the stylesheet with auto margins and the display style of "block," whatever that means.

			I also added a section linking to the minor comics, which looks a mess, but I put each comic name on a new line for readability.-->
		<h2>In the Comics</h2>
			<img class="center" src="img/tinyengi.jpg" height="140" width="53" title="Look at him. He's so cute.">
			<p style="text-align: center">Just a short king sipping some coffee.</p>
			<p>The Engineer's plotline in the main set of <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/comics.php">TF2 comics</a> is quite separate from that of his former coworkers. After all of the mercs are fired, Engineer is hired by the Administrator to maintain her life-extending machine. Because the Administrator is the Administrator, shenanigans are implied to ensue in the 7th comic. Don't worry, though. You don't have to be afraid. The 7th comic is never coming out, after all.</p>
			<p>The Engineer is also featured in the short comics
